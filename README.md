# Currency Converter

A simple app written in React and TypeScript for currency conversion. It uses Currency Data API from [apilayer/currency_data-api](https://apilayer.com/marketplace/currency_data-api).

Note: Access to the API requires an access key. You can sign up at [apilayer](https://apilayer.com/) and subscribe to Currency Data API for a free API key.
Once you have the API key, you can update the headers variable in `src/requests.ts`.
